## Getting Started

### Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173/dashboard.html`

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` folder.

## Deployment to Netlify

### Settings

If the repository root is the project folder:
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `dist`

If the project is in a subdirectory:
- **Base directory**: `crupids-dashboard`
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `dist`

### Why It Works Now

The `netlify.toml` and `public/_redirects` files ensure:
1. The build command runs correctly
2. The site root (`/`) redirects to `/dashboard.html`
3. Netlify serves the right files from the `dist` folder

## How It Works

### Data Persistence

All data is stored in **localStorage** in your browser:
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ No server required
- ✅ Instant sync
- ✅ Free
- ✅ Private to your device

Data includes:
- Tasks and completion status
- Priority levels
- Streak information
- Profile picture
- Custom settings (wake/sleep times, dashboard title)
- Daily start times

### Task Lifecycle

1. **Add tasks** for today or tomorrow
2. **Set priorities** by clicking the colored dot
3. **Reorder** by dragging
4. **Move to tomorrow** by dragging to the tomorrow card
5. **Complete** by checking the box
6. **Automatic rollover**: Incomplete tasks from previous days roll forward
7. **Streak calculation**: Complete all tasks to maintain your streak

### Day Management

The dashboard tracks each day independently:
- Click the center ring to **start your day**
- Day state persists even if you refresh
- New days automatically rollover incomplete tasks
- Wake/sleep times control the ring's progress visualization

## Tips

- **Start each day** by clicking the ring - this initializes tracking
- **Set priorities** as you add tasks to stay focused
- **Use drag-and-drop** to quickly reorganize or defer tasks
- **Check settings** to view your stats and adjust your schedule
- **Upload a profile picture** to personalize your dashboard
- Tasks automatically save when you make changes
